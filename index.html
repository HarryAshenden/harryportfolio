			<h2> Key Skills </h2>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3> Geophysical Surveying </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Been involved in various geophysical surveys, including the subsequent making of in-depth geophysical reports of areas in Liverpool and Tenerife, developing my report making skills.</li>
						<li>Used multiple geophysical techniques, including Magnetic Gradiometry, Gravity, Magnetics, seismic methods and electric tomography. The usage of these geophysical surveys enhanced my organisational skills as I partook in the analysis and interpretation of a wide variety of geophysical data simultaneously. </li>
						<li>Created a dissertation on the EM-34, giving an in-depth analysis of the electromagnetic method and evaluate how effective is the geophysical method. The project allowed me to gain an understanding of a new, complicated system and enhanced my research skills by leading a project throughout the academic year. </li>
					</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3> Technical/Computational Skills </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Developed my computational skills and techniques in my degree program such as data modelling and seismic processing in various software environments (MATLAB, UNIX, Python).</li>
						<li>Spent two weeks on a field course reading and producing detailed geophysical results e.g. seismograms, gravity + magnetic profiles etc. in Tenerife, displaying my strong aptitude in maths and IT.</li>
						<li>Extensive knowledge of Microsoft Office Applications due to constructing reports in Word, creating presentations in PowerPoint and formulating databases in Excel.      </li>
					</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3>Verbal and written communication </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Gained confidence in speaking to groups of people throughout my degree, which has been refined by delivering numerous presentations and leading team projects. </li>
						<li>Participated in a number of seminars in a selection of modules, which involve discussing and debating a wide range of new geophysical concepts, helping me gain experience in the critical analysis of research ideas and the active discussion of developing theories. </li>
						<li>Tennis coaching across a range of ability levels. This involves tailoring my methods of communication to each level so that I can communicate effectively and present my points and opinions to the public. </li>
					</ul>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3>Teamwork </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Gained experience in working environments such as volunteering for a geophysical firm, acquiring beneficial teamwork experience in the near-surface geophysics industry. </li>
						<li>Working in a geophysical survey team on a field trip in Tenerife which involved planning a geophysical survey with a range of techniques to assess the best plan of action. This experience has improved my ability to efficiently partake and lead projects from start to finish and has fuelled my desire to succeed by going the extra mile and working overtime on positive outcomes for the team. </li>

			<h2> Job Experience + Volunteering </h2>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>
					<h3> Tennis Coach (July 2014 – September 2017) </h3>
					<p> I was employed as a tennis coach at South Ribble Tennis Centre, teaching a range of tennis-specific skills in a clear and safe manner. I developed positive relationships with parents, other tennis coaches and the community, acting as a positive role model for the children and in the community. I overlooked the progress of young tennis players’ ability, actively making decisions on what the optimal route is for their potential to be reached. </p>
					</td>
					<td>
					<h3> Geophysical Survey Assistance (2018, 2019) </h3>
					<p> I have assisted in geophysical surveys conducted by a Geophysical firm called RSK. In December 2018, I took part in a 1-week survey which involved the attempt to discover underground tunnels beneath St. George’s Hall. In October 2019, I took part in a 1-day survey to detect any boreholes on the promenade in Cressington, which involved the use of a GPR. Using the equipment in a working scenario gave me pivotal work experience in the environmental sector. </p>

			<h2> Projects </h2>
				<h3> Geophysical Dissertation </h3>
				<h4> The EM-34 – Ground Conductivity Mapping with a Two-coil Inductor </h4>
				<p> For my final year university project, I launched an investigation into an electromagnetic geophysical field method called the EM-34, designed to measure ground conductivity. I investigated why the survey method was not widely accepted to an industry level by examining the EM theory and principles and how an output of ground conductivity is obtained. The thesis below consists of this investigation, as well as a number of case studies that I performed as part of my project. The case studies allowed me to analyse various concepts of an EM-34 survey and reach a valid conclusion that the EM-34 should be accepted to an industry level. </p>
